### Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

#### Motivation

With the proliferation of daily expenses tracking and goal oriented saving apps. One can feel the constant need of updating expenses daily to be troublesome.

Those are short term oriented tracking applications.

In the long term, we see the solution of having a dedicated saving tracker(separate from expenses) being much more feasible. As people can focus on their long term goals by putting money aside in advance to save and keep track of that without the pain of constantly tracking daily expenses.

Savings can take many forms as people age, and to track these different types of savings can be cumbersome. Many have resorted to use of excel sheets which require updates and formatting as their savings increase or different forms of savings are added.

With our application, the cumbersome process of formatting and making sure information is accurate will be much easier.

#### Aim

We hope to make tracking of ones’ savings goals easy in the long run.

#### User Stories

1. As a financially savvy individual, I wish to have a better overview of my savings and level of debts to make better financial decisions which can benefit me in the long run.

2. As someone who will be doing different types of investments on different platforms, I want to be able to have a simple summary of all my investments together.

3. When finding out the total savings, I have to open multiple platforms or accounts to tabulate total savings or I have to use an excel sheet and check through manually, I wished I had a simple solution.

#### Scope of Project

The system will be an Android Mobile Application, that allows users to track their net worth in a centralised dashboard. They can see more details in the respective categories:

- In equities, the user can enter their owned equities and average purchase price and track their Profit & Loss based on live stock prices.
- In debt, users can track their loans, monthly payments and time to complete repayment.

Throughout the application, the user will be able to see fluid graphs to visualize their finances and see current and projected returns/losses.

#### Features to be completed by the mid of June:

1. Allow users to sign up/create an account.
2. Allow users to add Cash/Equities information in the application.
3. Implement a centralized dashboard that allows a consolidated view of all the user’s financial information, along with individual sections for savings & equities.
4. Use Alpha Vantage API to provide live value of user’s equites based on current market prices.

#### Features to be completed by the mid of July:

1. Allow users to add in debt to better view net worth.
2. Allow users to view current and projected returns/losses.
3. Allow users to visualize their finances by implementing graphs and charts.
