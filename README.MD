#### Motivation

With the proliferation of daily expenses tracking and goal oriented saving apps. One can feel the constant need of updating expenses daily to be troublesome.

Those are short term oriented tracking applications.

In the long term, we see the solution of having a dedicated saving tracker(separate from expenses) being much more feasible. As people can focus on their long term goals by putting money aside in advance to save and keep track of that without the pain of constantly tracking daily expenses.

Savings can take many forms as people age, and to track these different types of savings can be cumbersome. Many have resorted to use of excel sheets which require updates and formatting as their savings increase or different forms of savings are added.

With our application, the cumbersome process of formatting and making sure information is accurate will be much easier.

#### Aim

We hope to make tracking of onesâ€™ savings goals easy in the long run.

#### Scope of Project

The system will be an Android Mobile Application, that allows users to track their net worth in a centralised dashboard. They can see more details in the respective categories:
